Assessment Description
Assessment Task:
You are required to create a case study of an Internet of Things (IoT) system. The case study must contain two deliverables:1. A written report in which you must present a scenario which may benefit from an IoT solution, using the Raspberry Pi and associated external sensors via the GPIO. You must describe the context of your scenario and propose your solution.2. A prototype of your system based entirely on the sensors included in the CrowPi kits. You must submit your Python code and provide a demonstration of your working prototype.
The scenario must be realistic and feasible but could be in any context. For example, it could be based within a home or office to improve living standards or help protect the elderly; it could be based in a public space to help monitor the environment; or any other context of your choice.
Examples of potential solutions might include a burglar alarm, a baby monitor, an environment monitor, a remote device control system, etc.
The prototype should not be a fully-fledged system that can be used in a full-scale context, but should be a proof-of-concept version that demonstrates how the system could potentially operate.
1. The Written Report
The written report should be approximately 1000 words in length (20% either side, ie. 800-1200 words) and must include the following sections:· Introduction: An introduction to your document that concisely sets out the topic of your case study and the aims and content of the rest of your report.· Scenario: An explanation of your scenario and the nature of the challenges that exist in your chosen context. You should then outline your proposed IoT solution and highlight the benefits it will bring to your chosen scenario. Identify the types of sensors and output devices that would be required and the role that they would play as part of your system. Note that these devices do not necessarily need to feature on the CrowPi, here you should be discussing a full-scale version of your solution.· Visual Representation: A visual layout or schematic diagram to show where IoT equipment would be placed in a full-scale version of your system. For this you can make use of a free planning tool such as those discussed in class (eg. RoomSketcher) or alternatively use Microsoft Word, Powerpoint or take a photo of a hand-drawn image. You should overlay some images, or icons to represent the IoT hardware.· User Interface: An explanation of a suitable IoT User Interface for a smartphone or other device that will allow your system to be monitored and/or controlled. What information will the interface provide to users and what will it allow the user to do? You should include a mock-up screenshot of your interface. An example of such an interface can be seen here: https://www.openhab.org/ Again, this can be created using a suitable graphics package or hand-drawn.
Where necessary you should include references and citations, presented in line with the USW Harvard Referencing Guide. Your report should be formatted to good academic standards (table of contents, page numbers, headings etc).
2. The Prototype
Your prototype system must be implemented entirely using a CrowPi kit as used in class. It should make use of the CrowPi sensors and/or outputs to replicate the system proposed in your written report, on a smaller scale.
The implementation must make use of at least three sensors and/or output devices that will operate in a complementary way to produce a useful system.
As a prototype, the system you create does not necessarily need to include all features of your proposed IoT solution as described in the written report. For example, your proposed system might entail use of an output device that is not included in the CrowPi, so you might substitute this with a text output to the CrowPi display. Or the proposed system might require multiple sensors, some of which are unavailable, so an alternative sensor could be used, or the sensor could be left out of your prototype system (assuming other sensors are implemented).
You must submit your Python code and provide a demonstration of your working system. No marks are awarded for the prototype without a demonstration.
Hints for achieving better grades:· Do not feel constrained by the features on the CrowPi when proposing your solution. Your written report might refer to sensors or outputs that are not available on the CrowPi, but can be substituted or left代 写IS3S687 Advanced Integrated Computing DevicesPython
代做程序编程语言 out of your prototype implementation.· However, you should choose a scenario and solution that allows you to demonstrate your skill at using the CrowPi, so think carefully about which sensors are available and would allow you to create a viable prototype.· When creating diagrams and visuals, don’t worry too much about using professional software. A photo of a hand-drawn picture that clearly shows the content you are intending to represent will suffice, although it is still important that any visual content is detailed and presented to a high standard.· Use references to support your proposed solution. As far as possible, don’t copy/paste material verbatim from existing sources; paraphrase into your own words. Whether you are quoting verbatim or paraphrasing, cite and reference your sources using the USW version of the Harvard System. A description is available at: https://library.southwales.ac.uk/collections-subject-guides/referencing/· Take care of the word count and do not miss out on marks for writing too much or too little. Keep the writing concise. If your report is too verbose or unfocused then you are likely to lose marks. Try to avoid unnecessary jargon, explaining complex terminology where it is used.· Look carefully at the assessment criteria to ensure you are covering aspects that will be needed to earn marks. Do not forget to include all sections that are set out in this assignment brief or you will miss out on potential marks.· Take care to maintain Academic Integrity. Avoid plagiarising, colluding, or other types of Academic Misconduct. Details of these are provided here: https://studyskills.southwales.ac.uk/academic-misconduct/what-academic-misconduct/· If in doubt about any aspect of this assignment, ask your lecturer for clarification.A video can be found on the Assessment tab on Blackboard, providing additional guidance.Guidance on Format of Assessment

Submission Details
You must submit:· An electronic copy of a Word document that contains your written report via the Blackboard Turnitin link. Hard copies are not required.· Python code for your prototype via the Blackboard link. Hard copies are not required.· You must provide a demonstration of your working prototype following submission. Timeslots for demonstrations will be arranged in liaison with your lecturer.
What happens next?
Your marked assessment should be available 20 working days after submission.  However, please be advised that this may be subject to change in the event of Bank Holidays, University Closure or staff sickness.  If there is something about the feedback you have been given that you are unclear about, please see your module tutor.
Feedback Method
Feedback will be emailed to you.
Late Submission 
The assessment submission slot on Blackboard will remain open after the deadline has passed. If it necessary for you to submit your work late then you should submit your work through the same method and inform. your lecturer when you have done so. Your work may then be assessed, if appropriate.
Retrieval in the Event of Failure
Resit assessments opportunities will be available in the summer if appropriate. This assessment is eligible for In Year Retrieval.
